## All my Ai codes i made in Simpleplanes, will be here!
i 'll upload all my Ai codes on here as i can
## Does these codes are truly an "Ai"?
usually, lot of peoples at simpleplanes.com (including me) categorized those codes as "Ai".
but actually, i don't think it would dare be called as "Artificial intelligence". because they're are something scarily smart, but what i designed is just pre-programmed codes, which is designed to control the Air & Ground vehicles as we intended.
But for convenience reasons, it is being called as "Ai".
## How to apply it?
__in files__
open the target vehicle's XML file on your device, and
Just copy all the codes we've written here from 
```
<Variables>
```
to
```
</Variables>
```
and overwrite it on the line where all the variables are saved.
__in game__

make sure to change the inputs for codes, instead of normal inputs for user's control. 
give your controller to robot!

For Wheels : `Steer` 

For Engine(s) : `clamp01(Acc)` (if that is __Ai Police__, type `Acc` instead)

##### Wait! Here's Warning!! Important!!!
if you're about to porting our codes on your precious vehicle (especially if you didn't uploaded on somewhere), __Make sure to make its backup file before you take these actions!!!__
