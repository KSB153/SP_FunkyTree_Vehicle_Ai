## All my Ai codes i made in Simpleplanes, will be here!
i 'll upload all my Ai codes on here as i can
## Does these codes are truly an "Ai"?
usually, lot of peoples at simpleplanes.com (including me) categorized those codes as "Ai".
but actually, i don't think it would dare be called as "Artificial intelligence". because they're are something scarily smart, but what i designed is just pre-programmed codes, which is designed to control the Air & Ground vehicles as we intended.
But for convenience reasons, it is being called as "Ai".
## How to apply it?
Take and copy all the codes we've written here (from <variable> to </variable>), and just paste it on the target vehicle's XML file.
### But Wait! Here's Warning!! Important!!!
if you're about to porting our codes on your precious work (especially if you didn't uploaded somewhere), __Make sure to make its backup file before you take these actions!!!__
