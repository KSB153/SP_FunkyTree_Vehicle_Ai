## All my Ai codes i made in Simpleplanes, will be here!
i 'll upload all my Ai codes on here as possible
## Does these codes are truly an "Ai"?
usually, lot of peoples at simpleplanes.com (even i am) categorized those codes as "Ai".
but actually, i don't think it would dare be called as "Artificial intelligence". because they're are something scarily smart, but what i designed is just pre-programmed codes, which is designed to control the Air & Ground vehicles as we intended.
